Why files ?
- saving data persitently.
we have db.

Files:
+ read
+ writing
+ append

modes:

r -> read a file.
w -> write into a file -

 DISCLAIMER: if you open a file in write mode 
* if the file is not there, your create a new file.
* if there is a file,you are going to truncate it.

a -> append mode.
you an always keep on appending to a file.
b -> binary mode. ex: jpg
ex: rb,wb,ab  ex: pickle,json

r+ -> both read and append to a file.

Type:        builtin_function_or_method
String form: <built-in method read of file object at 0x7f0cbc1a8540>
Docstring:
read([size]) -> read at most size bytes, returned as a string.

If the size argument is negative or omitted, read until EOF is reached.
Notice that when in non-blocking mode, less data than what was requested
may be returned, even if no size parameter was given.

Type:        builtin_function_or_method

In [20]: f.seek?
Type:        builtin_function_or_method
String form: <built-in method seek of file object at 0x7f0cbc1a8540>
Docstring:
seek(offset[, whence]) -> None.  Move to new file position.

Argument offset is a byte count.  Optional argument whence defaults to
0 (offset from start of file, offset should be >= 0); other values are 1
(move relative to current position, positive or negative), and 2 (move
relative to end of file, usually negative, although many platforms allow
seeking beyond the end of a file).  If the file is opened in text mode,
only offsets returned by tell() are legal.  Use of other offsets causes
undefined behavior.
Note that not all file objects are seekable.

Type:        builtin_function_or_method
String form: <built-in method readline of file object at 0x7f0cbc1a8540>
Docstring:
readline([size]) -> next line from the file, as a string.

Retain newline.  A non-negative size argument limits the maximum
number of bytes to return (an incomplete line may be returned then).
Return an empty string at EOF.

Docstring:

Call readline() repeatedly and return a list of the lines so read.
The optional size argument, if given, is an approximate bound on the
total number of bytes in the lines returned.

optimizations previously implemented in the xreadlines module.

Type:        builtin_function_or_method

Note that due to buffering, flush() or close() may be needed before
the file on disk reflects the data written.

Docstring:
close() -> None or (perhaps) an integer.  Close the file.

Sets data attribute .closed to True.  A closed file cannot be used for
further I/O operations.  close() may be called more than once without
error.  Some kinds of file objects (for example, opened by popen())
may return an exit status upon closing.
