oop - object oriented programming.

programming 
+ Function based programming
+ object oriented way of writing a program.

OOP
- A - Abstraction
- P - Polymorphism
- I - Inheritance
- E - Encapuslation


Abstraction
-------------

car is a mix of variables(-) and function(+).

variables(-)/data
function(+)/methods

ex1:

car      -> class/classobject
- color  -> data
- model
- build
- wheels
+ break  -> method
+ acceleration
+ clutch
+ GPRS


objects/Instances
- audi
- bmw
- honda
- hyundai
- maruti
- nano

ex2:

villa -> class/classobject/blueprint
- bedrooms
- dining
- auditorium
- kitchen

Objects/Instances
- Mahendra (yellow)
- mayuri   (pink)

ex3:

banking
- bal
+ deposit
+ withdraw
+ balance
+ interest

Objects/Instances
- soujanya
- mreddy


 Polymorphism
 -----------------

 Poly - many
 morphism - forms

 kumar ( Instance/object)
 - trainer
 - Founder
 - employee
 - son
 - husband
 - father

 Intrest
 - personal
 - eductional
 - car
 - home

 In [1]: a = 10

In [2]: b = 20

In [3]: a + b
Out[3]: 30

In [4]: c = "python"

In [5]: d = "rocks"

In [6]: c + d
Out[6]: 'pythonrocks'

In [7]: a.__add__(b)
Out[7]: 30

In [8]: c.__add__(d)
Out[8]: 'pythonrocks'

In [9]: a + c
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-9-e81e582b6fa9> in <module>()
----> 1 a + c

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'

Inheritance
--------------

Father
Mother (left handed)
- child1
- child2(left handed)

we can inherit some function or variables from parent class.
we dont need to over code.


Encapuslation
----------------

we are more concerned about the functionality rather than worry about data.

* Data hiding
- public,private,protected


Banking
- balance  ( i dont want to access the variable directly)
+ deposit
+ withdraw

Storage device(pendrive)
