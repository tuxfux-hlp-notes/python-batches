oop - object oriented programming

programming
+ functioncal based programming
+ object oriented programming - programming in a real world scenerio

A - Abstraction
Defination of object.

car      - class/blueprint
 - model 
 - color
 - wheels
 + break
 + clutch
 + acclerator
 + power windows

ex: model,color,wheels as data/variables.
ex: break,clutch,acclerator as method/functions.

A combination of both the data and methods is called as attributes.

Objects/instances:
- Honda city.
- skoda
- audi

ex 2:
villa - class/superclass

objects
santosh - pink
mahesh  - yellow
kaushik - green

P - Polymorphism

Poly - Many
morphism - Forms

In [1]: "linux" + " rocks"
Out[1]: 'linux rocks'

In [2]: 1 + 1
Out[2]: 2

In [3]: 1.0 + 2.3
Out[3]: 3.3

ex: bank interest

I - Inheritance
Inheritance - inheriting form your parent

Father:
 left handed
 doctor

Mother:
 right handed
 doctor

son:
 left handed
 film actor

E - Encapsulation

Encapsulation is more about dealing with function rather than internals.

bank

ACCOUNT
balance - i am not touching this variable directly. I am using the function to touch this value.
deposit()
withdraw()
viewbalance()

ex: pen drive

- hiding of the data(java/c/c++)  ex: we dont have this feature in python
public
protected
private
